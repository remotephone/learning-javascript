Working through stuff to learn javascript. Most of the work is coming from the JavaScript Pocket Guide. I am working through and extrapolating on the examples as I go. 


I am using nodejs instead of Firebug as recommended cause I am only tangentially interested in building webpages, I mostly want to learn the scripting of javascript.

I will skip sections I am not sure interested in. 

Structure is something like this, where the number preceding each file name breaks it into sections roughly aligned with chapter sections, but not necessarily. :

```
├── 01_Intro
│   ├── 01.1_test.js
│   ├── 01_reserved_words.md
│   ├── 02.1_test.js
│   ├── 02.2_test.js
│   └── 02_functions_and_objects.md
├── 02_Chapter_2
│   ├── 01.1_test.js
│   ├── 01_lesson1.md
│   ├── 02.1_test.js
│   ├── 02.2_test.js
└── README.md
