You can escape text like in other languages


```javascript
"He said "hello!"";
SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
"She said \"hello!\"";
"She said "hello!""
'They say "hello!"';
"They say "hello!""
```

concat strings with +

```javascript
myString = myString + " world";
"hello world"
myString += " world";
"hello world"
```

All strings have one built in property.


```javascript
"akljasfoie".length
10

var mystring = "akljasfoie";
mystring.length
10
```
